This is a game that I made for my AI Game module's assignment.

Some of the features that were implemented:
- AI state machine for the units and the enemy AI player
- A* Pathfinding on hexagon tiles
- DFS (Explore state for the enemy AI player)
- Procedural map generation
- Visibility range (All units of each player share it)
â€‹
Note: 
It was made with the focus of AI so the graphics, game design and controls aren't very good. 
Was also doing other other assignments during this time, so not 100% of the duration was spent on this project

Some things are unknown / unclear since the project was done long ago.
